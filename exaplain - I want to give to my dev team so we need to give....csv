"1. Initial Setup and Interface Adjustments
These initial steps are designed to de-clutter the interface, focusing the tool purely on the price-angle relationship before introducing external timing factors.",,,
Item,Setting/Control,Purpose & Detail,Gann Principle Rationale (The 'Why')
Moon Phases & Cycles,Unclick (Disable),Removes auxiliary timing indicators from the bottom bar.,"Focus on Core Geometry: While Gann used lunations, the primary focus of the Square of 9 is the geometric structure and angular relationships of price. Disabling these focuses the analysis on the main chart's angularity."
Planets,Unclick (Disable),Hides all planetary glyphs from the center of the Square of 9.,Layered Analysis: This allows the user to first analyze the price angles (support/resistance) on the Square of 9 in isolation. Planetary influence is added back on demand later as a timing overlay.
Aspects (Hide),Click Hide,"Hides the angular relationships (aspects like Trines, Squares) between the planets in the Cosmogram.","Prioritizing Placement over Aspect: For Gann's ""Squaring the Circle,"" the most critical factor is the planet's exact placement on a price-angle, not its aspect to another planet. Hiding aspects reduces visual noise."
Triangle / Square,Ensure only Square is selected.,"Confirms the chart type is the Square of 9, the foundation of this analysis.",Foundation of Gann Geometry: The Square of 9 is the most popular Gann wheel for calculating price extensions and support/resistance levels based on its logarithmic spiral progression.
"2. Square of 9 Core Structure Settings
These settings establish the mathematical foundation and progression of the Square of 9 chart itself.",,,
Rotation,Clockwise (Must be selected),Determines the direction of the numerical spiral progression around the square.,Angular Direction: The standard Square of 9 starts at a base angle (usually 0/1/10) and numbers progress clockwise. This direction is mandatory for the correct angular calculation and price-to-angle conversion.
Size,Slider/Input (Adjustable Digits),Controls the total range or number of rings/spirals displayed on the square.,"Price Range Calibration: A larger ""size"" extends the spiral, allowing the analysis of higher-priced assets. It defines the scale of the chart to fit the relevant price range of the instrument being analyzed."
Data Type,Price (Always selected),"Designates the numbers in the cells as representative of market prices (e.g., $100, $101, etc.).","Price-to-Angle Conversion: This is the core function. The cell number's angular position (e.g., 90 degrees) is used to calculate the price targets based on the starting price."
Value (Center),Input (Typically 1),Sets the starting value for the center cell of the Square of 9.,"Standard Wheel Configuration: Setting the center value to 1 creates the classic Gann Wheel, where the square's angular geometry is most directly applicable to price movement."
Increment,Input (Typically 1),Sets the value by which numbers increase between adjacent cells.,"Step Unit: An increment of 1 creates a linear price increase between steps (e.g., 100, 101, 102). This can be changed (e.g., to 0.1 for currencies) to match the asset's typical minimum price fluctuation."
Find,Input Field (Enter Price),Allows the user to input a specific price number to highlight its location (angle) on the square.,Target Identification: Used to quickly determine the angular coordinate of a key historical price level (high or low) on the square. This angle is then projected forward to find future turning points.
"3. Highlight, Marking, and Measurement
These tools are for visually identifying and plotting the most significant geometric points on the Square of 9, derived from the number 90.",,,
Cardinal Cross (Visible),Checkbox / Set to Cross,Displays the two main cross-hairs: The Cardinal Cross (0/90/180/270 degrees) and the Fixed Cross (45/135/225/315 degrees).,"The Power of 90 and 45: Gann stated that price will often reverse or find major support/resistance after moving 90, 180, or 360 degrees in price from a previous top/bottom. The 45-degree angles are equally critical half-steps and turning points."
Marking (Left/Right Click),Left-Click to Mark; Right-Click to Unmark.,Allows the user to manually plot significant historical high or low prices onto the Square of 9.,"Squaring the Price: Plotting a previous extreme price (e.g., the high) on the square is known as ""Squaring the Price."" All numbers that fall on the same angle as that marked price become major projected support/resistance levels for future trades."
Protractor (Angle Set to 0),Set Angle to 0 and Clockwise,"Visually displays the degrees (0-360) around the square, anchored at the starting point.","Astronomical Anchor: 0 degrees on the Square of 9 is often aligned with the Spring Equinox (0° Aries), which serves as the traditional zero point for astrological and astronomical measurements used in Gann analysis."
"4. Cosmogram and Ephemeris (Timing Factors)
The Cosmogram section links the static price structure (Square of 9) to the dynamic, real-time positions of the planets—the core of Gann's time-based analysis.",,,
Cosmogram Visible,Checkbox,Turns on the display of the real-time positions of the planets and the zodiac wheel.,"Squaring Time and Price: This enables the ""Squaring of Time and Price,"" where market movements are believed to correlate with planetary angles."
System,Geocentric (Must be selected),Sets the coordinate system for calculating planetary positions.,Earth-Centric View: The geocentric system places the Earth (and thus the market and the observer) at the center of the solar system. This is the standard and required perspective for nearly all financial astrology.
Time Frame,User / UTC Offset,"Allows the user to define their time zone (e.g., UTC+3) for planetary calculation.","Accuracy of Timing: Planetary positions are highly time-sensitive. The Ephemeris (table of planet positions) must be calculated for the correct time zone (e.g., the exchange's time or the trader's time) to ensure the angular degree is accurate for market entry/exit signals."
Date & Time (Today/Now),Checkboxes / Manual Input,"Used to set the time for analysis: Today/Now for real-time trading, or manual input for historical backtesting.","Cycle Identification: Historical backtesting is crucial for identifying recurring cycles (e.g., a market turning every time Jupiter returns to a specific angle) and finding the natal chart (the date of the first trade/listing) of an asset."
Planetary Checkboxes,"Click on any planet (e.g., Mars)",Places a planetary glyph on the price number of the Square of 9 that corresponds to the planet's current angular degree.,"Price Target from Angle: This is the execution of the ""Squaring the Circle"" method. When a planet's angular position (its ""time"" factor) lands on a critical price angle (0, 45, 90 degrees) on the Square of 9, it generates a high-probability timing signal for a market turn."
